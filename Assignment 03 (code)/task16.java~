/*Task 16: Write javacode of a program that reads an integer, and if the number is even and greater than 10, 
 * prints“An even number greater than 10”. If the number is even but lesser than 10, print “An even number not
greater than 10”. If the number is greater than 10 but odd, print “An odd number greater than 10”. If the
number is odd and also less than 10, print “An odd number less than 10”.*/
